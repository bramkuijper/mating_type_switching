\begin_layout Abstract
Predictions about evolutionary transitions in sex-determination mechanisms
 have been mainly formulated in animals and plants, whereas the evolution
 of sex-determining mechanisms in groups such as algae, fungi and ciliates
 is still poorly understood.
 One remarkable means of sex-determination occuring in these groups is mating-ty
pe switching, in which a haploid parent attains a different mating type
 than its offspring or later genetic descendants.
 Here we study

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Explaining the remarkable diversity in sex-determining mechanisms has been
 a long-standing question in evolutionary biology 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Indeed, numerous models have been developed to explain transitions between
 different sex-determining mechanisms in animals and plants (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Doorn2014"

\end_inset

).
 By contrast, groups like fungi, ciliates or slime molds have received much
 less attention: existing models exclusively focus on the evolution of the
 number of sexes, or `mating types' (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

; reviewed in

), whereas few predictions exist about evolutionary transitions between
 different forms of mating-type determination 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Paixao2011"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to animals and plants, however, fungi, ciliates, algae or slime
 molds exhibit a substantial amount of variation in mating-type determining
 systems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, and rigorous theory is lacking to understand their evolution.
 By default, mating-type determination in these groups relies on a single-locus
 system, in which each mating type is associated with a distinct allele
 that is inherited in a Mendelian fashion 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Phadke2009,Umen2011,Nieuwenhuis2013"

\end_inset

.
 However, many variations exist: in most basidiomycetes, for example, mating
 type alleles reside at multiple loci, rather than at one locus 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Billiard2011,Nieuwenhuis2013"

\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, some fungi have lost distinct mating types, as different
 alleles are present within the same haploid genome 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Lin2007a"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even more interesting is the repeated evolution of non-Mendelian forms of
 mating-type determination, where mating types switch between parents and
 their offspring or later descendants.
 For example, in a number of ciliates such as 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
emph{Paramecium}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, an individual's mating type is epigenetically determined by the macronucleus
 in the parent

\end_inset

, and can be modulated dependent on the parental environment

\end_inset

.
 In the ciliate 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_inset

, mating type is determined stochastically, so that mating types switch
 between one of 7 adjacent mating type alleles through recombination each
 generation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Paixao2011,Cervantes2013"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, in several distantly related species of ascomycete yeasts (e.g.,

emph{Saccharomyces}, 
\backslash
emph{Schizosaccharomyces} and

), individuals contain at least one copy of both mating type alleles, but
 only express one of both through different mechanisms including epigenetic
 silencing or ectopic recombination

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why has mating-type switching repeatedly evolved? Despite numerous studies
 focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying switching, few hypotheses
 exist about their evolutionary origins.
 Naively, one could argue that mating type switching allows a typically
 outbreeding organism to occasionally mate with their sibling gametes when
 mates are limited.
 However, yeasts, for example, largely reproduce by selfing anyway 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Alternatively, mating type switching has evolved

\begin_layout Standard
To study the evolution of mating-type switching, we study a model of haploid
 mating type determination, in which the mating type of a gamete is determined
 by its haploid genome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We model a population of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 haploid cells, where each cell is characterized by a mating type locus
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, harboring alleles 
\begin_inset Formula $\{M_{1},M_{2},M_{3},â€¦,M_{m}\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the maximum number of different mating types in the population.
 An individual harboring allele 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{i}$
\end_inset

 cannot mate with all other individuals bearing allele 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, we also consider a mating type switching locus 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 which modifies the action of the mating type alleles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume a life cycle in which cells undergo 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 rounds of vegetative growth.
 During each round of vegetative growth, each cell produces 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the frequency of existing genotypes is doubled (so the population grows
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $2N$
\end_inset

) and then sampling 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 cells without replacement to form a new population of size 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 At each vegetative growth step we assume that the two daughter cells inherit
 their parentsâ€™ switching genotype.
 If the mother cell has the switching allele, one daughter will inherit
 the maternal mating type and the other daughter cell will switch its mating
 type with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 We assume that a switching cell can switch its mating type to any other
 type in the population with equal probability.
 Following the vegetative stage, cells are allowed to mate with one another
 at random.
 Only cells that are heterotypic at the mating type locus can mate.
 It follows that we end up with a maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $N/2$
\end_inset

 diploid cells, which will then undergo meiosis to give rise to the new
 generation.
 If the number of mated pairs is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $N/2$
\end_inset

, we sample with replacement from the haploid cells that are produced after
 meiosis until the population size returns back to 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 No switching occurs at the meiotic step.
 We also assume no recombination between the mating type locus and the switching
 gene.
 The life cycle is illustrated schematically on Fig.

\begin_layout Subsection
Two mating types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin by considering a population with two mating types (
\begin_inset Formula $m=2$
\end_inset

).
 We introduce the switching gene at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\mu}$
\end_inset

, at low frequency, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

, and determine the probability of fixation for varying 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 In the absence of selection we expect the switching gene to reach fixation
 with probability equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wright1931,Ewens2010"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the number of vegetative generations between sex increases so does drift
 on the mating type locus, making switching advantageous.
 So as 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 increases from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $500$
\end_inset

 we see a sharp increase in the fixation probability for the switching gene
 (Fig.
 2A).
 Although the effects of drift are more pronounced for smaller populations
 and larger g, the probability of fixation is nearly doubled contrasted
 to that expected under drift even for larger populations (
\begin_inset Formula $N>500$
\end_inset

) and small 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The time the switching mutant appears is also important, particularly for
 smaller populations (Fig.
 2B).
 Selection for the switching gene only acts at sex.
 It follows that mutations that trigger mating type switching which appear
 early in the vegetative phase of the life cycle can be lost due to drift
 before they become subject to selection.
 We know from existing theory [ref] that this is more likely to occur in
 smaller populations and when the vegetative growth period between the appearanc
e of the mutant and sex is prolonged.
 This explains why the switching mutant is closer to neutral for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=100$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{Î¼}<50$
\end_inset

 in Fig.
 2A.
 When the population size is large (
\begin_inset Formula $N>1000$
\end_inset

), the timing of the mutation has little impact on the probability of its
 fixation (Fig.
 2B).
 Note that even then, the variation generated in the population distorts
 the sex ratio sufficiently to provide a selective benefit for the switching
 gene (the fixation probability is about three times larger than that expected
 under drift; Fig.
 2B).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We proceed by varying the probability of switching.
 The same qualitative picture emerges for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=100$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $500$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1000$
\end_inset

: changes from 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.25$
\end_inset

 result in a significant increase in the fixation probability (Fig.
 2C).
 For small 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $=100$
\end_inset

) this reaches a value larger than 6 times the expected fixation probability
 under drift.
 The increase in pfix is less steep for larger populations (
\begin_inset Formula $N>500$
\end_inset

) but a robust selective advantage remains.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To better understand the evolutionary dynamics of this system, and the reason
 why further increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\mathrm{fix}}$
\end_inset

 appears to be neutral, we fixed the frequency of the switching gene at
 different values and estimated the selective advantage of the mutant over
 a single round of the life cycle (Fig.
 3A).
 Our findings indicate strong frequency dependent selection.
 When the mutant is rare it has more than a double-fold advantage (for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=100$
\end_inset

, Fig.
 3A).
 This declines sharply as the mutant spreads in the population and the mutant
 becomes neutral when its frequency increases above 0.8.
 When at low frequency the mutant has a large advantage as the sex ratio
 before sex is largely distorted and cells having the capacity to produce
 offspring of both mating type will have an advantage.
 As the frequency of the mutant increases, the sex ratio during the vegetative
 growth becomes more even and the relative advantage of the mutant declines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A similar picture emerges when we simulate the evolution of the switching
 gene quantitatively.
 Because our model operates within a finite population scheme, we do this
 as follows.
 We assume that the population is initially at a state where the switching
 probability, pswitch, is equal to 0 for all individuals.
 We then introduce a mutant, s, at low frequency so that individuals carrying
 s have 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\prime}=p+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, and measure the selection advantage of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 We repeat this iteration from 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

.
 Further details are provided in the Methods section.
 We can see from Fig.
 3B that selection is stronger as pswitch increases from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2$
\end_inset

, but that further increase results in very shallow gradients.
 Fig.
 3C shows the ratio of the two mating types in the population following
 a single round of vegetative growth for different values of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and frequencies of the switching gene 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 This reinforces what we saw in Fig.
 3A and 3B: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Varying selection pressure and the cost of switching 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Switching is likely to be costly.
 This could be due to the time or energy required for the switching itself
 (e.g.
 for gene deletion and duplication [ref]), or due to an increased chance
 of inbreeding.
 We ask what are the effects of a switching cost on our findings.
 We define a cost function,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
f\left(p;c,k\right) & =1-cp^{k}\label{eq:cost_function}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is the cost of switching and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 determines the shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\cdot)$
\end_inset

.
 A cost dictated by 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is imposed on cells carrying the switching gene at each mitotic step so
 that the probability of a cell being sampled at each vegetative step (Fig.
 1) is equal to the cost function.
 This has a significant impact on the fixation probability of the switching
 gene, particularly for larger populations and higher switching rates (Fig.
 4).
 It follows that in situations with low selection for the switching gene
 (e.g.
 large populations with frequent sex), a high cost for mating type switching
 is likely to either compromise switching rates or impede the spread of
 the switching gene all together.
 (NOTE: this is good, there are cases where switching would not spread!).
 We can comment more on the shape of the cost function and tis effect on
 the outcome.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(We have thus far assumed minimal pressure in partner finding in that as
 long as cells of different mating type are present in the population they
 will mate.
 We asked how would varying selection pressure during sex alter our results.
 If the time during which cells can form sexual pairs or only a proportion
 of them can mate.
 This is in effect what in terms of the life cycle? ? this makes no real
 difference, it can go in the SI).
 An alternative would be to look at fluctuating population sizes.
 For example, we can assume that after sex only a few spores survive (e.g.
 because variation following sex means some super fit and some super unfit
 offspring).
 Then we go from N down to N/q and then amplify back to N and grow for a
 bit.
 This is an alternative way of generating variation, may be getting a bit
 repetitive but I can try it and we can think of it as SI if nothing interesting
 comes up.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multiple mating types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many species have multiple mating types (m>2) [refs].
 How does the number of mating types affect our findings? In this section
 we vary m from 2 to 20 and compute the fixation probability of s.
 The larger the number of mating types, the more advantageous the switching
 gene.
 Also, pfix increases with population size.
 Here is why (I think):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multiple mating types means partner finding is easier Vegetative growth
 means that even if the ratios of the different mating types are approximately
 the same following sex, there will be some distortion in the ratio by the
 time the population has sex again This means that some types will be rare
 or lost Cells that can switch can make daughters of all types, including
 rare ones (see histograms in Fig.
 5) This will give them an advantage This advantage is actually larger for
 larger populations (Fig.
 5).
 This is because in small populations with many mating types there is a
 lot of drift which means that rare types will end up being lost instead
 of remaining rare and advantageous (I have some histogram comparisons for
 this, this will be SI material) The increase in pfix with the number of
 mating types plateaus after a point.
 I think that this is because no additional advantage for more mating types
 exists after m>10 or so.
 Or at least the advantage for additional types is very low.
 I need to think about this better.
